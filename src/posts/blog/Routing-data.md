## Circuit Switching and Packet Switching 
Circuit switching and Packet switching decribes two ways used to transmit data across a network of connected links and routers like the internet or telephone network. 


### Circuit Switching
Circuit switched networks transfers data between the sender end system and reciever end system via a dedicated communication connection for the duration of the transfer session.

In this configuration, when the connection between the two end system are estabilished, the transfer of data is guaranteed a constant rate.
- Examples includes the telephone network.

### Packet Switching
In this configuration, when the connection between the two end system are estabilished, there transfered is guaranted the full transmission rate of links that forms the connection path.
